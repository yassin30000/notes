// CALL STACK

    // definition
        // The call stack is a structure that JavaScript uses to keep track of the evaluation of function calls.

    // notes
        // when a function is called, a new frame is added to the top of the stack

        // when a function returns, it is popped off of the stack

        // any event (like setTimeout) cannot be handled until the callstack is empty
